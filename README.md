# AcademicBiblicalBot
A bot written for reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical.

Update 11 March 2018: The bot was not accepted by the mods of /r/AcademicBiblical and as such no longer has a purpose. I'm however leaving this up in case I ever need to reuse the code or get a refresher on how to program Reddit bots, and also as a memento of my first Reddit bot.
